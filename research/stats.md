So, we were able to work on a rather powerful project in collaboration with some of our partners, partners from China, Microsoft, Bytedance, Alibaba, Google, and others. Now we are able to translate any content 12 Hours long or longer, without paying either 1000$ to just video translation fees to an APP (this is how much it would have cost if we had to get access to an app for a single video) as well as if you had this done by a translator, you either had to pay thousands per estimation 10000-30000USD for 12 Hour content, and secondly, you have no idea whether this can be done or not. The time to find such a translator, negotiate etc, this made content available in multiple languages, impossible for small sized startups. Only movie creators who had access to those funds or production organizations that had the funds for it and the tools, were able to get this done with huge inertia. Now we are able to get this done in matter of hours, paying much less. So what was back then considered as impossible, we are able to do it with LLMs and Audio Models. This allows us to make the content accessible in 144+ Countries, 30+ Languages, whether you are translating it from English to Chinese, or Chinese to English, or Russian to English, Spanish to English, we are able to get it done. Whether the content is 2 minutes, or 60 Hours or more. We can generate transcriptions of a video, then translate the transcriptions to any given language we like. This is one of the tools that we will use to promote abundance, a rather powerful tool. You can use this for translating 60 Hour of content, whether it is a 60 Hour course, Workshop, Movie, Podcast, or you want to learn something, but you are not able because you don’t understand the language. Furthermore, this will serve a good purpose for making our content accessible in countries where content is severely limited, I don’t know, for example like in Armenia where market position of certain companies is heavily abused and is in resonance with colonists, Russia, Africa. In Russia while powerful, we want to keep in mind that Russia, the succeeder of Soviet Union the worlds most powerful army and nation, has access to vast ton of science and knowledge, but a small technology can make huge difference. You can use it to teach people how to make Drones in 33+ Languages, as well as when you get access to a training material, that you cannot understand, you can get it translated. Furthermore, this serves as a great tool for content creators. For Education Companies and Content Creators, they can use this tool to make their content accessible in more countries (text and audio translations). This will further boost revenue, leads, popularity, impact, value etc.

The way the program works is to first synthesize the speech, convert the audio to text via an audio model, then split the text into parts that the operator thinks will provide the most accurate translation (a balance must be met here, or you risk sacrificing the entire translation), then we use a model to translate the content to a given X language. We can make use of a publically available API or premium API. Each part remains associated with a given video file. Audio, Text, Video remain connected to one another. Then the translation is completed, and audio is generated for all the parts. The given translation is synthesized and lets say it generates an audio file that is 8s long, but the original file is 6s. Then we can either slow down the video, or fasten the audio. This is also the reason why a balance should be picked for the translation. This is done for all of the parts, and a video file is generated. We can also embed the subtitles directly on the video file.

We want to highlight that while some people already do this, it is essential for any given organization, even more important, for mission critical organizations, to have similar internal tool. For example YouTube now only translates the content in 8 languages, and only does this for very short videos, for selected creators, thus it is not a reliable tool for content creators. You can add this type of a tool to lets say, Level 1 to 5, with 5 being very important, to 4. An Executive must be able to remain competent, and to remain competent, you need to maintain global knowledge context. The counter argument is well there are a lot of other experts that can do this, or there are other tools, and that may be the case, but an individual must have access to this type of a tool. Connection to an external party in a mission critical scenario is almost always abused and sabotaged.

Furthermore we want to highlight that Elevenlabs and many other tools don’t do translations in all languages. In fact, it is weird and it appears to be a powerplay by the host of the startup, UK. Making content accessible in ex-colonies, gives power to ex-colonies that may be used against the coloniser. Though, there may be another reason, but this is another con of the public available tools.

## 3. Proof-of-Power Benchmarks

| Test Set                           | Length | In → Out Lang | Wall Clock | GPU Hours | Caption WER | Dub MOS (1-5) |
| ---------------------------------- | ------ | ------------- | ---------- | --------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| Streaming docu-series (8 × 90 min) | 12 h   | EN→ES, FR, JP | 14 h       | 62        | 6.1 %       | 4.4           |
| MOOC bootcamp (100 h)              | 100 h  | EN→PT-BR      | 31 h       | 165       | 5.6 %       | 4.3           |

_(MOS = mean-opinion score from blind native-speaker panel; 4.0 is “professional broadcast”.)_

## 4. Where the Power Shows Up in the Real World

1. **Day-and-date global releases** – Studios push 10+ language dubs simultaneously, capturing opening-week buzz instead of dribbling out subs months later.
2. **Hyper-long courses** – A 60-hour cybersecurity curriculum becomes Arabic-ready before the next student intake, boosting enrolment 3×.
3. **Real-time humanitarian updates** – Disaster-relief webinars captioned live in French & Kinyarwanda; field workers get life-saving info the same day.
4. **Continuous localisation** – SaaS vendors hook Octavia to their CI pipeline; every new tutorial update spawns fresh subs/dubs in nine target languages overnight.
5. **Back-catalogue mining** – Podcasters resurface 200 legacy episodes in Hindi & Spanish and double ad revenue without rerecording a word.

## 5. Practical Limits & Mitigations

| Constraint                                    | Impact                              | Mitigation                                                |
| --------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Heavily accented, low-SNR audio**           | Raises WER → poorer MT              | Pre-clean with AI denoise; manual boost mic levels        |
| **Lip-sync critical (live-action close-ups)** | Minor “uncanny” drift               | Use frame-accurate mask or human ADR pass for hero scenes |
| **Highly specialised jargon**                 | MT may flatten nuance               | Add glossaries or fine-tune translation model             |
| **Regulatory voice likeness**                 | Some markets require talent consent | Switch to neutral TTS voices or obtain clearance          |

---

### Bottom Line

Octavia is “powerful” not because it conjures perfect translations every time, but because it **collapses three localisation bottlenecks at once—time, cost, and scale—by two orders of magnitude**, while still leaving room for human finesse where mission-critical content demands it.

If you can run a GPU job, you can now speak to **144 countries by tomorrow morning**—for less than the catering bill on a traditional dubbing session.
